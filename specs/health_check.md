# Health Check Service

## Purpose
To provide a simple health check endpoint for the API, allowing clients to verify service availability.

## Endpoint Specification
1. Endpoint: /health
2. Method: GET
3. Request: No body or parameters required.

## Response Format
  - Success Response:
  - Code: 200 OK
  - Content: { "status": "healthy" } - Indicates that the service is up and running.

## Error Handling
Since this is a health check endpoint, it typically doesn't have complex error handling. However, in the case that the service itself is down, it would naturally return standard HTTP error responses (such as 503 Service Unavailable), which are usually handled by the infrastructure (like load balancers or API gateways) rather than the service itself.
